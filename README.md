# Hi, I'm Ritesh Puttanmadam! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer dedicated to transforming ideas into robust, scalable applications. I love turning coffee into code â˜• and tackling challenges that drive innovation. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in databases and different programming languages such as **Java, Python, C/C++, SQL, HTML, CSS,** and **JavaScript**. This foundation has empowered me to excel in building solutions that are both efficient and impactful.

In my journey, I've embraced frameworks and tools like **React, Node.js, Django,** and various cloud platforms, always striving to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Beyond coding, I contribute to open source projects, share insights on tech trends, and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow.

When I'm not immersed in code, I'm brainstorming new ideas ðŸ’¡ or exploring the latest developments in technology. I'm always open to collaborations and new challengesâ€”**let's connect and build something amazing together!** ðŸš€
